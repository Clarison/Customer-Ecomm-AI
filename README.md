# 1)Customer Lifetime Value Prediction. 

This feature leverages sophisticated algorithms to analyze purchasing patterns and calculate a customer's lifetime value, taking into account variables such as churn, discount, profit margin, and years. With a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), businesses can easily input their data and receive predictions for each customer's lifetime value. The software also features advanced data visualization tools, presenting the information in an intuitive and visually appealing way. With this new feature, businesses can make informed decisions about customer acquisition, retention, and loyalty, ultimately leading to increased profitability and improved customer satisfaction.

# 2)Targeted Audience 

A powerful new feature that allows businesses to target their ideal customers more effectively. Through careful analysis of previous purchases, we have identified specific customer demographics that are most likely to be interested in a given product. By providing this information, businesses can better tailor their marketing efforts and allocate resources more efficiently. In addition, we have introduced an advanced analytics feature that presents detailed information in visually appealing graphs. These graphs provide insights into customer demographics such as age, gender, Income, and more. This information can help businesses to further refine their marketing efforts and better understand their target audience. With these new features, businesses can optimize their marketing efforts and increase their overall revenue.

# 3)Advanced Recommendation 

The new feature I developed for the software is a product recommendation system. The system leverages collaborative and context-based recommendations to suggest products that are likely to be of interest to the user. Collaborative recommendations are based on patterns of purchases made by different customers. For example, the system looks at different baskets and products bought together to suggest items that are frequently purchased together. Context-based recommendations, on the other hand, are based on the customer's recent product selection. For instance, the system may recommend selling a similar product to boost sales or upsell. Additionally, the system uses AI to generate personalized messages that are tailored to each customer. These messages are designed to provide a human-like touch, making customers feel more engaged and valued. Overall, the new product recommendation system helps to increase customer engagement and boost sales by suggesting products that are likely to be of interest to each customer.
